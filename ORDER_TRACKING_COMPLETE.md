# ✅ Order Tracking - Complete Implementation

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Order Model (`backend/Models/Order.js`)
Added:
- **Status tracking**: `pending`, `confirmed`, `processing`, `shipped`, `out_for_delivery`, `delivered`, `cancelled`
- **Timeline events**: Array of tracking events with status, title, description, timestamp
- **Tracking number**: Unique identifier for each order
- **Auto-timeline**: Automatically creates initial "Order Placed" event on creation
- **Estimated delivery**: Optional delivery date
- **Notes**: Admin notes field

### 2. Tracking Routes (`backend/Routes/tracking.js`)
Created new endpoints:
- `GET /api/tracking/:orderId` - Get order tracking details (authenticated, own orders only)
- `POST /api/tracking/:orderId/update` - Admin update order status and add tracking events

### 3. Updated Order Creation (`backend/Routes/order.js`)
- Auto-generates tracking number on order creation
- Format: `BEN-{timestamp}-{random}`

### 4. Frontend Order Tracking Page (`frontend/src/pages/OrderTracking.jsx`)
Updated:
- Fetches real tracking data from API
- Shows order status, tracking number, total amount
- Displays timeline with proper icons and colors
- Loading states and error handling
- Responsive design with animations

## 📊 Order Status Flow

```
pending → confirmed → processing → shipped → out_for_delivery → delivered
                                                        ↓
                                                   cancelled
```
